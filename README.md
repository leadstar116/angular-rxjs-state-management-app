# Simple Angular App using RxJS state management 

## Project Details
Created an angular 7 project with 3 components. <br/>
Search component that accepts a form input field, and two radio buttons(see diagram below).  <br/>
The user enters a search string and based on the radio selection either a Bing Results Component or Google Results Component will be loaded onto the page via DI. <br/>
When the Search string is entered,  State Service would be notified and either Bing/Google will be loaded via the <router-outlet> with a simple text â€œthis is the (bing/google) component. <br/>
This component can be used for any search service. Easy for extendable. <br/>
